# suggested approach

.medium[

- work through material for each Chapter

- once you've finished a Chapter, test your  
understanding by completing the  
associated exercise

- don't peek at the solutions too quickly `r emo::ji("smile")`

- create an R script to document your code  
(preferably in an RStudio Project)

- use R's help pages and Google when you get stuck!

# What is R?

<br>
.medium[

- answer depends on who you ask and what they use R for

- environment for statistical computing, graphics and programming

- originally created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman (1996) 

- currently maintained by international R-core development team 

- many, many people also contribute to R and the wider  
R community

# why is R considered hard?
]

.pull-left[
.medium[

- high initial investment in time to learn R

- unfamiliar command line environment

- frustrating (and sometimes) inconsistent syntax

- analysis and figures can take longer (initially!)

- relatively steep learning curve

- it's not actually that hard, just unfamiliar

# using R - objects


.medium[

- commands are typed in the editor and then sourced into the console  
at the > prompt

```{r, simple, prompt=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
2 + 2
```

- R is object orientated. You can create variable and assign value(s) to them

```{r, simple2, prompt=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
a <- 2 + 2
a
```
]

---

class: left, top

<br>

# using R - objects

.medium[

- once created, operations can be performed on variables 

```{r, simple3, prompt=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
a <- 2 + 2
b <- 3 * 2

a + b
```

- this is very powerful and flexible 

- much of the functionality of R is enhanced by using variables called functions 

]
---
class: left, top

<br>

# using R - functions


.medium[
- functions contain a set of instructions that allow you to perform a specific task(s)

- you can use functions that are inbuilt in R

```{r, simple4, prompt=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
numbers <- c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6)   # use the concatenate function
numbers

mean(numbers)                 # use mean function

var(numbers)                  # use variance function
```

- comments (#) are ignored by R

- there are packages for almost anything

<br><br><br><br>
- install packages from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/)

- packages are easy to install in R

- or write your own functions

- function to calculate standard error

<br>
```{r, simple5, prompt=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
numbers <- c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6)    # use the concatenate function

se.fnc <- function(x){         # start function for se
 std.x <- sd(x)		             # calculate SD
 nos.x <- length(x)		         # calculate number obs
 se.x <- std.x/(sqrt(nos.x))   # calculate SE
 print(se.x)	
}

se.fnc(numbers)                # use your new function
```

# using R - syntax 

.medium[

- R is case sensitive `A` is not the same as `a` 

- commands are generally separated by a new line, but you can also use a `;` (rare)

- anything that follows the hash symbol (#) will be ignored by R. Use this to comment your code 

- a series of commands can be grouped using braces `{ }`

- write pretty code by following a [code style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html)

# using R - plots 

.medium[

- by default plots are displayed in the 'Plots' pane in RStudio

- plots can be copied and pasted into your word processor of choice 

- better to export plots to an external file (jpeg, pdf, png etc)

]
---
class: left, top

<br>
# using R - help 

.medium[

- R has extensive help facilities

- from within R the main method of getting help is to use the `help()` function

```{r, simple6, prompt=TRUE, eval=FALSE, collapse=TRUE}
help("plot")    # open help file for the function plot
```

or equivalently

```{r, simple7, prompt=TRUE, eval=FALSE, collapse=TRUE}
?plot
```

- or to search the help files use `help.search("plot")` or `??plot`

- [Google it!](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=R+Error+in+library+there+is+no+package+called): Try Googling any error messages you get. It's not cheating and everyone does it! You'll be surprised how many other people have probably had the same problem and solved it.

- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r): There are many thousands of questions relevant to R on Stack Overflow

- [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r?sort=votes) are the most popular ones, ranked by vote. Make sure you search for similar questions before asking your own

- make sure you include a [reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example/5963610#5963610) to get the most useful advice. A reproducible example is a minimal example that lets others who are trying to help you to see the error themselves.

# tips for learning R

.medium[

- use R often and use it regularly

- learning R is not a memory test, you have your R scripts

- you don’t need to know everything there is to know about R to use it productively

- staring at code for hours is not good for you. Walk away for a few minutes

- there are many ways to tackle a particular problem. See what others have done

- recognise that there will be times when things will get a little tough or frustrating. Try to accept these periods as part of the natural process of learning a new skill (we’ve all been there) and remember, the time and energy you invest now will be more than payed back in the not too distant future.
